# MOTCOAIS-2

It's like my other repo, Murder on the Cusp of an Icsmaun Sunset, but now using RPG20XX (https://web.archive.org/web/20160202021152/https://subversion.assembla.com/svn/rpg20xx/dl/rpg20xx.zip) instead of ObEngine.

To explain on that (since Sygmei is probably the only one who will see this anyway), as much as I enjoyed the freedom of being able to write everything in Obengine, I also hated having to write code for literally everything. RPG20XX provides a mostly visual enviroment, while also having some simple scripting to makes things behave how I want them to.
