# MOTCOAIS-2

It's like my other repo, Murder on the Cusp of an Icsmaun Sunset, but now using RPG20XX (https://github.com/l33ner/RPG20XX-mirror) instead of ObEngine.

To explain on that (since Sygmei is probably the only one who will see this anyway), as much as I enjoyed the freedom of being able to write everything in Obengine, I also hated having to write code for literally everything. RPG20XX provides a mostly visual enviroment, while also having some simple scripting to makes things behave how I want them to.
